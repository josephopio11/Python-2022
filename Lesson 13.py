# Loops: something that repeats over and over

# FOR
# year_12 = ['Dalton', 'Derrick', 'Fatma', 'Havilla']
#
# for x in year_12:
#     print(x)


# range(x,y,z)

for i in range(0, 100, 3):
    print(i)

# Exercise: Using a for loop, generate a list of even
# numbers from 150 to 600

for x in range(150, 601, 2):
    print(x)

# # Codes to try out:
# for x in range(5):
#     print(x)
#
# for y in range(3, 8):
#     print(y)
#
# for z in range(3, 15, 2):
#     print(z)


# WHILE
